## Small To-Dos (Priority) - ALL COMPLETED ✅

~~### 1. Editor Text Alignment Issue~~ ✅ FIXED
~~### 2. Project Bar Redesign~~ ✅ COMPLETED
~~### 3. Add Contextual Tools to Project Bar~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED
~~### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts~~ ✅ WORKING GLOBALLY
~~### 5. Fixed-Width Font Issue~~ ✅ RESOLVED WITH GOOGLE FONTS

## Next Major Phases

### Phase 3: Claude Chat Integration (Not Started)
- Implement chat interface in right panel
- Message bubbles with markdown rendering

- Conversation management (multiple tabs)
- API key management

### Phase 4: Enhanced Multi-Project Support (Partially Complete)

- Need: Project templates
- Need: Project search/filter
- Need: Recent projects quick access

### Phase 5: Git Integration (Not Started)
- Git status indicators in file tree
- Bottom panel for Git operations
- Commit interface

- Theme persistence per project
- Custom theme creation

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Performance
- Optimize file tree for large projects
- Implement virtual scrolling for long files
- Add file content caching

### Error Handling
- Better error messages for file operations
- Recovery from corrupted settings
- Graceful handling of missing projects

### UI/UX
- Add file search (Ctrl+P)
- Global search across project (Ctrl+Shift+F)
- Split editor view
- Minimap for code navigation

## Known Issues
1. Scrolling works but could be smoother
2. No right-click context menus yet
3. No file/folder creation from UI (only opening existing)
4. No rename/delete operations from UI

## Development Environment
- Flutter SDK: Windows installation
- Target Platform: Windows Desktop (primary), macOS/Linux (future)
- State Management: Provider
- Key Packages:
  - split_view: Panel resizing
  - flutter_highlight: Syntax highlighting
  - window_manager: Window control
  - file_picker: File/folder selection
  - google_fonts: Fixed-width font support

## Session Notes for Next Developer
When starting the next session:
1. Read this file first
2. Check CLAUDE.md for project context
3. Run `flutter pub get` if needed
4. Test current build with `flutter run -d windows`
5. Start with the "Small To-Dos" section above

The codebase is well-structured with clear separation:
- `/lib/models/` - Data models
- `/lib/services/` - Business logic
- `/lib/widgets/` - UI components
- `/lib/screens/` - Main screens
- `/docs/specs/` - Phase specifications

Good luck!
