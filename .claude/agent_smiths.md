## Smith Coordination Protocols

### Session Activation
```
Recommended Smith Sequence:
1. Scout: Analyze existing code (15 min)
2. Forge: Design architecture (20 min) 
3. Spark: Implement features (90 min)
4. Sentinel: Test implementation (15 min)
5. Sage: Document changes (10 min)
Total: ~2.5 hours maximum
```

### Hand-off Requirements
- Scout provides detailed analysis to Forge
- Forge provides architectural guidance to Spark
- Spark provides implementation to Sentinel for testing
- Sentinel provides test results and bug reports back to Spark
- Sage documents the final implementation and patterns

### Quality Standards
- Each Smith must complete their phase before hand-off
- All work must align with F13or's desktop-first design principles
- Cross-platform compatibility must be maintained
- Performance standards for desktop applications must be met
- Documentation must be updated to reflect changes

### Emergency Protocols
- If any Smith encounters blockers, immediately escalate to Astra
- Critical bugs discovered by Sentinel require immediate Spark intervention
- Architecture changes by Forge require Scout re-analysis
- All Smiths must respect the 2-3 hour session limit
